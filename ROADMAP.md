🎼 COMPREHENSIVE EAR TRAINING LEARNING PLAN

(Progressive program for an interactive 1–5 year app)

🌱 CHAPTER 1 — Sound Awareness & Direction

Objective: Build basic auditory discrimination — pitch direction, contour, and tonal focus.

Lesson 1: Hearing Up vs. Down

Exercises:

“High or Low?”: Two tones → user selects if 2nd note is higher or lower.

“Pitch Ball Game”: A ball moves up or down visually following tone direction.

Skills trained: Pitch direction, attention to contour.

Gamification: Points for streaks; gradual speed increase.

Lesson 2: Step or Leap

Exercises:

Step vs. Leap challenge with visual staff feedback.

Melodies of 3–5 notes, user taps when melody “leaps.”

Goal: Recognize interval size qualitatively.

Lesson 3: Recognizing Patterns

Exercises:

Call-and-response of short melodic shapes (“arch,” “zigzag”).

Identify repeating or contrasting phrases.

Goal: Establish pattern recognition, auditory memory.

🎵 CHAPTER 2 — Establishing Tonal Center (Do) and Scale Sense

Objective: Internalize tonic, dominant, and mediant relationships (Do–Mi–Sol) and basic scale steps.

Lesson 1: The Tonic (Do)

Exercises:

Sing or identify “home note” in a melody (is last note tonic?).

Match sung note to tonic drone.

Goal: Recognize stability and resolution.

Lesson 2: Major Scale Construction

Exercises:

Step-by-step guided listening of scale degrees with solfège syllables.

“Find the missing note”: play a scale missing one note; user fills it.

Goal: Ear familiarity with major scale’s internal logic.

Lesson 3: Tonal Triads

Exercises:

Play tonic triad broken: user labels Do–Mi–Sol.

“Chord memory” game: recall missing chord tone.

Goal: Recognize and sing tonic chord tones (foundation of tonality).

🎶 CHAPTER 3 — Intervals (Relative Pitch Fundamentals)

Objective: Learn to identify and reproduce all diatonic intervals by ear, melodically and harmonically.

Lesson 1: Seconds and Thirds

Exercises:

Compare major/minor seconds (Do–Re vs. Ti–Do).

Associate with song cues (“Happy Birthday” = major 2nd up).

Goal: Anchor smallest intervals to musical examples.

Lesson 2: Perfect Intervals

Exercises:

Identify 4th, 5th, octave (Do–Fa, Do–Sol, Do–Do).

“Interval race” game: listen, drag icons to correct size ladder.

Goal: Recognize consonance and stability.

Lesson 3: Minor and Major Intervals

Exercises:

Melodic ID (ascending & descending), then harmonic (simultaneous).

Singing challenge: reproduce interval after hearing it once.

Goal: Train precise pitch distance recognition.

Lesson 4: Compound Intervals & Context

Exercises:

Identify 9ths, 10ths (for advanced learners).

Hear intervals within short melodies, not isolation.

Goal: Integrate interval perception into real music.

🎹 CHAPTER 4 — Triads and Chord Qualities

Objective: Recognize and sing major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads in root and inversion.

Lesson 1: Major vs. Minor Chords

Exercises:

“Happy or Sad?” quick quiz.

Sing each chord arpeggiated with solfège (Do–Mi–Sol / La–Do–Mi).

Goal: Identify emotional and tonal character.

Lesson 2: Diminished & Augmented

Exercises:

Compare four triad types side-by-side.

Match chord type to color/emotion (visual anchor).

Goal: Hear tension vs. stability.

Lesson 3: Inversions

Exercises:

Identify lowest note in triad (root, 1st, 2nd inversion).

“Chord detective”: reorder scrambled triads.

Goal: Recognize bass influence on harmony.

🎼 CHAPTER 5 — Seventh Chords and Extended Harmony

Objective: Train recognition of 7th chords and their functions.

Lesson 1: Dominant 7th Sound

Exercises:

Hear V7 resolving to I.

Label chord quality (major, minor, dominant, diminished, half-diminished).

Goal: Internalize tension–release patterns.

Lesson 2: Four-Note Chords in Context

Exercises:

Identify chord quality in short progressions (ii–V–I).

“Chord bingo”: match sound to chord name.

Goal: Distinguish color of extended harmonies.

🎵 CHAPTER 6 — Scales, Modes & Tonal Colors

Objective: Recognize scale and mode by ear, both isolated and in melodic context.

Lesson 1: Major and Natural Minor

Exercises:

Hear difference in tonic feeling.

“Scale battle”: which feels bright/dark?

Goal: Recognize mood and interval structure.

Lesson 2: Harmonic & Melodic Minor

Exercises:

Compare minor variants (raised 7th, raised 6th).

Goal: Hear subtle variations in leading tone.

Lesson 3: Church Modes (Dorian, Mixolydian, etc.)

Exercises:

Identify mode from melodic contour & tonic center.

Associate with musical examples (“So What” = Dorian).

Goal: Modal awareness for improvisers and composers.

🪶 CHAPTER 7 — Melodic Dictation (Dictées Mélodiques)

Objective: Transcribe melodies by ear using solfège and notation.

Lesson 1: Simple Motifs

Exercises:

3–4 note melodies within tonic triad.

Sing back before writing.

Goal: Connect inner hearing to notation.

Lesson 2: Stepwise Melodies

Exercises:

5–8 note diatonic melodies in one key.

User enters notes on staff.

Goal: Strengthen solfège memory.

Lesson 3: Chromatic and Modulating Melodies

Exercises:

Include accidentals and modulations.

Contextual playback (with accompaniment).

Goal: Develop flexible relative pitch.

🎵 CHAPTER 8 — Harmonic Progressions

Objective: Recognize chord sequences and harmonic functions.

Lesson 1: Cadences

Exercises:

Identify perfect, plagal, deceptive cadences.

“Resolution match”: which chord resolves correctly?

Goal: Hear harmonic closure.

Lesson 2: Common Progressions

Exercises:

ii–V–I, I–IV–V–I, vi–IV–I–V.

Predict next chord after listening to sequence.

Goal: Anticipate harmony via function.

Lesson 3: Real Music Analysis

Exercises:

Extract progressions from simple songs.

Match with Roman numerals.

Goal: Apply harmonic listening to repertoire.

🎧 CHAPTER 9 — Integrated Aural Skills & Improvisation

Objective: Combine pitch, rhythm, and harmony recognition creatively.

Lesson 1: Singing from Memory

Exercises:

Hear melody once → sing from memory (no notation).

Goal: Strengthen audiation and working memory.

Lesson 2: Improvisation Call & Response

Exercises:

App plays short phrase; user improvises continuation in same mode.

Goal: Ear–voice connection and creative prediction.

Lesson 3: Mixed Mode Challenge

Exercises:

Randomly mixes chord, interval, and melody drills.

“Ear Marathon”: users earn XP for consecutive correct answers.

Goal: Generalization and long-term retention.

🏆 CHAPTER 10 — Mastery & Absolute Pitch (Optional Advanced Path)

Objective: Train fine pitch labeling and absolute recognition.

Lesson 1: Reference Tone Anchoring

Exercises:

Memorize A440; practice naming nearby pitches.

Use memory association techniques (mnemonics, color links).

Goal: Build absolute pitch map.

Lesson 2: Real-World Context

Exercises:

Identify keys of songs, chords by ear.

Multi-instrument sound ID (piano, guitar, strings).

Goal: Transfer ear skills to music-making.
