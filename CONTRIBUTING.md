## üéØ Types of Contributions

### üéµ Adding New Exercises

Exercises are the core of the application. Here's how to add new ones:

#### 1. Choose the Right Level
- **Level 1**: Beginner exercises (intervals, basic chords)
- **Level 2**: Intermediate exercises (chord progressions, scales)
- **Level 3**: Advanced exercises (modal recognition, complex harmony)

#### 2. Create the Exercise File
Create a new file in the appropriate level directory:
```bash
backend/exercises/level1/my_new_exercise.py
```

#### 3. Implement the Exercise
```python
from exercises.base.exercise import BaseExercise
from exercises.base.metadata import ExerciseMetadata
from exercises.base.interval_exercise import IntervalExerciseData, IntervalExerciseResult

class MyNewExercise(BaseExercise):
    metadata = ExerciseMetadata(
        id="my_new_exercise",
        name="My New Exercise",
        description="A description of what this exercise teaches",
        difficulty=2,  # 1-5 scale
        prerequisites=["basic_intervals"],
        learning_objectives=[
            "Learn to identify perfect intervals",
            "Develop aural recognition skills"
        ],
        category="interval_recognition",
        tags=["intervals", "perfect", "melodic"]
    )
    
    def generate(self, **kwargs) -> IntervalExerciseData:
        # Generate exercise content
        # Return IntervalExerciseData with audio, options, etc.
        pass
    
    def check_answer(self, answer: str, context: dict) -> IntervalExerciseResult:
        # Validate user answer
        # Return IntervalExerciseResult with correctness and feedback
        pass
```

#### 4. Add Tests
Create tests in `backend/tests/test_exercises.py`:
```python
def test_my_new_exercise():
    exercise = MyNewExercise()
    data = exercise.generate()
    result = exercise.check_answer("Perfect Fifth", data.context)
    assert result.is_correct
```

### üé® Frontend Improvements

#### Adding New Components
1. Create components in `frontend/src/components/`
2. Use TypeScript for type safety
3. Follow React best practices
4. Add proper error handling

#### Styling Guidelines
- Use CSS modules or styled-components
- Follow the existing design system
- Ensure responsive design
- Test on multiple browsers

### üîß Backend Enhancements

- Use Django REST Framework serializers
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Include API documentation

#### Music Theory Extensions
- Extend `backend/music_app/` with new theory functions
- Add support for new scales, chords, or progressions
- Ensure compatibility with existing exercises

### üê≥ Docker and Deployment

## üìù Code Style and Standards

### Python (Backend)
- Use `ruff` for formatting and linting
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all public functions

### TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend)
- Use ESLint and Prettier
- Follow React best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries

### General Guidelines
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test types
make test-unit        # Unit tests only
make test-integration # Integration tests only
make test-coverage    # Tests with coverage report

# Run frontend tests
cd frontend && npm test
```

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases

### Test Structure
```python
def test_exercise_generation():
    """Test that exercise generates valid data."""
    exercise = MyExercise()
    data = exercise.generate()
    
    assert data is not None
    assert data.target_audio is not None
    assert len(data.options) > 0
    assert data.correct_answer in data.options
```
