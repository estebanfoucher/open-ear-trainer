# Curriculum Navigation Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the hierarchical curriculum navigation system for the Open Ear Trainer application. The system provides a structured learning path through Chapters → Lessons → Exercises.

## Implementation Summary

### Backend (Django)

#### 1. Django Models (`backend/api_app/models.py`)

Three new models were created to represent the curriculum hierarchy:

- **Chapter**: Top-level learning modules
  - Fields: title, description, order, difficulty_level, is_published, created_at, updated_at
  - Example: "Intervals", "Direction & Contour"

- **Lesson**: Focused learning units within chapters
  - Fields: chapter (FK), title, description, order, learning_objectives, estimated_minutes, is_published
  - Example: "Melodic Intervals: Thirds and Octave"

- **Exercise**: Links lessons to actual exercise implementations
  - Fields: lesson (FK), exercise_type, title, description, order, difficulty_level, config (JSON), is_published
  - The `exercise_type` corresponds to exercise IDs in the exercise registry

#### 2. Database Migrations

- Created initial migration: `backend/api_app/migrations/0001_initial.py`
- Migrations applied successfully to the database

#### 3. Django Admin (`backend/api_app/admin.py`)

Registered all models with custom admin interfaces:
- ChapterAdmin: List display with order, difficulty, publish status
- LessonAdmin: List display with chapter grouping, inline exercises
- ExerciseAdmin: List display with lesson grouping, filterable by difficulty

#### 4. DRF Serializers (`backend/api_app/serializers.py`)

Created serializers for API responses:
- `ChapterListSerializer`: Includes lesson_count and exercise_count
- `ChapterDetailSerializer`: Includes nested lessons
- `LessonListSerializer`: Summary view with exercise_count
- `LessonDetailSerializer`: Includes exercises and chapter context
- `ExerciseSerializer`: Exercise details for curriculum

#### 5. API Views (`backend/api_app/views.py`)

Three new views for curriculum navigation:
- `ChapterListView`: GET `/api/chapters/` - Lists all published chapters
- `ChapterDetailView`: GET `/api/chapters/{id}/` - Chapter with lessons
- `LessonDetailView`: GET `/api/lessons/{id}/` - Lesson with exercises

#### 6. URL Configuration (`backend/api_app/urls.py`)

Added three new URL patterns:
```python
path("chapters/", ChapterListView.as_view(), name="chapter-list")
path("chapters/<int:chapter_id>/", ChapterDetailView.as_view(), name="chapter-detail")
path("lessons/<int:lesson_id>/", LessonDetailView.as_view(), name="lesson-detail")
```

#### 7. Seed Data (`backend/api_app/management/commands/seed_curriculum.py`)

Management command to populate initial curriculum:
- 3 Chapters: Direction & Contour, Tonal Center & Scale Sense, Intervals
- 5 Lessons within Chapter 3 (Intervals)
- 5 Exercises mapped to existing exercise implementations

Run with: `python manage.py seed_curriculum`

#### 8. Tests (`backend/tests/test_api/test_curriculum_views.py`)

Comprehensive test suite with 12 tests covering:
- Chapter list and detail views
- Lesson detail views
- Published/unpublished filtering
- Count accuracy
- Full navigation flow integration

All 186 backend tests pass.

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

#### 1. New Components

**ChapterList** (`frontend/src/components/ChapterList.tsx`)
- Displays grid of chapter cards
- Shows difficulty level, lesson count, exercise count
- onClick handler to navigate to chapter detail

**LessonList** (`frontend/src/components/LessonList.tsx`)
- Displays lessons within a chapter
- Shows estimated time and exercise count
- Back navigation to chapters
- onClick handler to navigate to lesson detail

**ExerciseList** (`frontend/src/components/ExerciseList.tsx`)
- Displays exercises within a lesson
- Shows breadcrumb navigation (Chapter → Lesson)
- Exercise difficulty badges
- Back navigation to lessons
- onClick handler to start exercise

#### 2. Updated App.tsx

Major refactoring to support navigation:
- New state: `currentView` ('chapters' | 'lessons' | 'exercises' | 'exercise')
- New state management for chapters, lessons, and curriculum exercises
- API integration for chapter/lesson fetching
- Navigation handlers (back buttons, selection)
- Preserved existing exercise execution logic

#### 3. Updated Styles

**index.css** additions:
- `.card-grid`: Responsive grid layout for cards
- `.chapter-card`, `.lesson-card`, `.exercise-card`: Card styles with hover effects
- `.chapter-header`, `.exercise-header`: Flex layouts for headers
- `.difficulty-badge`: Styled difficulty indicators
- `.chapter-stats`, `.lesson-info`: Info displays
- `.lesson-number`, `.exercise-number`: Order badges
- `.breadcrumb`: Navigation path display

## API Endpoints

### Chapter Endpoints

**GET /api/chapters/**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Intervals",
    "description": "Identify melodic and harmonic intervals by ear.",
    "order": 3,
    "difficulty_level": 3,
    "lesson_count": 5,
    "exercise_count": 5
  }
]
```

**GET /api/chapters/{id}/**
```json
{
  "id": 3,
  "title": "Intervals",
  "description": "Identify melodic and harmonic intervals by ear.",
  "order": 3,
  "difficulty_level": 3,
  "lessons": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Melodic Intervals: Thirds and Octave",
      "description": "Learn to identify melodic minor thirds...",
      "order": 1,
      "estimated_minutes": 15,
      "exercise_count": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### Lesson Endpoints

**GET /api/lessons/{id}/**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Melodic Intervals: Thirds and Octave",
  "description": "Learn to identify melodic minor thirds...",
  "order": 1,
  "learning_objectives": "Recognize melodic intervals by ear",
  "estimated_minutes": 15,
  "chapter_id": 3,
  "chapter_title": "Intervals",
  "exercises": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Minor Third, Major Third, and Octave (Melodic)",
      "description": "Identify melodic intervals...",
      "exercise_type": "minor_third_major_third_octave_melodic",
      "order": 1,
      "difficulty_level": 1,
      "config": {},
      "is_published": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## User Flow

1. **Landing Page**: User sees list of chapters with difficulty indicators and counts
2. **Chapter Selection**: Click "Start Chapter" → Navigate to lesson list
3. **Lesson Selection**: Click "Start Lesson" → Navigate to exercise list
4. **Exercise Selection**: Click "Start Exercise" → Begin 20-question exercise
5. **Back Navigation**: Users can navigate back at any level
6. **Breadcrumbs**: Chapter → Lesson shown in exercise list

## Data Model Relationships

```
Chapter (1) ←→ (N) Lesson (1) ←→ (N) Exercise
                                        ↓
                                   exercise_type
                                        ↓
                              ExerciseRegistry
```

- Chapters contain multiple Lessons
- Lessons contain multiple Exercises
- Exercises reference exercise implementations via `exercise_type`
- Only `is_published=True` items are shown to users

## Seeded Content

### Chapter 3: Intervals
1. **Lesson 1**: Melodic Intervals: Thirds and Octave
   - Exercise: Minor Third, Major Third, and Octave (Melodic)

2. **Lesson 2**: Melodic Intervals: Perfect Fourths, Fifths, and Octave
   - Exercise: Perfect Fourth, Perfect Fifth, and Octave (Melodic)

3. **Lesson 3**: Harmonic Intervals: Thirds and Octave
   - Exercise: Minor Third, Major Third, and Octave (Harmonic)

4. **Lesson 4**: Harmonic Intervals: Perfect Fourths, Fifths, and Octave
   - Exercise: Perfect Fourth, Perfect Fifth, and Octave (Harmonic)

5. **Lesson 5**: Combined Interval Recognition
   - Exercise: Combined Melodic Intervals

## Testing

### Backend Tests
- 12 new curriculum-specific tests
- 186 total backend tests passing
- Coverage includes:
  - Model creation and relationships
  - API endpoint responses
  - Published/unpublished filtering
  - Count calculations
  - Full navigation flow

### Manual Testing
- All API endpoints verified with curl
- Frontend components render correctly
- Navigation flow works end-to-end
- Exercise execution preserved

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Progress Tracking**: Track which lessons/exercises are completed
2. **Prerequisites**: Enforce lesson order based on completion
3. **Adaptive Difficulty**: Adjust exercise difficulty based on performance
4. **Achievement Badges**: Reward completion of chapters/lessons
5. **Exercise Variants**: Support multiple exercises per lesson with different configs
6. **Content Management**: Admin interface for non-technical content creation
7. **Soundfont Selection**: Per-exercise or per-lesson soundfont options

## Migration Path

The existing exercise registry (`SimpleExerciseRegistry`) is preserved and works alongside the new curriculum system. The frontend adapts the old Exercise interface to work with the new curriculum-based navigation.

Future work will fully integrate the exercise registry with the curriculum models, potentially deprecating the direct exercise list endpoint in favor of the curriculum navigation.

## Developer Notes

### Adding New Content

To add new chapters/lessons/exercises via Django admin:

1. Navigate to `/admin/`
2. Create Chapter → Create Lessons → Create Exercises
3. Set `exercise_type` to match an ID in the exercise registry
4. Set `is_published=True` to make visible
5. Set `order` fields to control display order

### Adding New Exercise Types

1. Implement exercise in `backend/exercises/`
2. Register in `SimpleExerciseRegistry` in `views.py`
3. Create Exercise record in admin with matching `exercise_type`
4. Link to appropriate Lesson

### Testing Locally

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python manage.py runserver

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm start

# Seed data
python manage.py seed_curriculum
```

## Summary

This implementation provides a solid foundation for structured, progressive learning in the Open Ear Trainer. The hierarchical navigation (Chapters → Lessons → Exercises) gives users a clear path through the curriculum, while the Django models provide flexibility for future content expansion and user progress tracking.
